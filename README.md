This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase development: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, resulting in an undefined or null value error. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous operations using promises or async/await to prevent this issue.  This leads to more robust and predictable Firebase applications.
